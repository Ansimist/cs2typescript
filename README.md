# cs2typescript
 
This program is designed to convert files from the vts format to vts_c. This file is a TypeScript script that can be read by the game CS2. You can create logic for your maps using this program.

## How to Include a Script in a Map
- Add an entity of class `point_script`.
- Add the "script" key to the entity and write the path to the file there.
- Add the "targetname" key to the entity and write the name of the entity there.
